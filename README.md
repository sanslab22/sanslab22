# As someone that loves cooking and trying out different recipies, I want to create an app that generates recipie ideas based on the produce that the user has. It should have a feature where users can choose their preferred cuisine, spice level and portion size. It would be great if users also have the ability to save their own reciepies on the app, like a recipie book.
